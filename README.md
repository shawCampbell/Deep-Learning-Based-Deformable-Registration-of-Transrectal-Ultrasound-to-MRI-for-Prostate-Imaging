# Deep-Learning-Based-Deformable-Registration-of-Transrectal-Ultrasound-to-MRI-for-Prostate-Imaging
This repository contains some of the main Jupyter Notebooks used to conduct research on deep-learning deformable registration of transrectal ultrasound to magnetic resonance imaging deformable registration.

The thesis associated with this code is included in this repository, which has the following abstract:

*"This study investigates weakly supervised deformable registration of transrectal ultrasound
(TRUS) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for prostate imaging. The work focuses
on evaluating the effectiveness of intensity-based similarity metrics versus label-driven
loss formulations, the impact of affine preprocessing, and the role of data augmentation
in improving model robustness. Using the MuRegPro dataset and a modified VoxelMorph
framework, the research systematically explores how architectural and preprocessing
choices affect multimodal registration accuracy. The findings demonstrate that intensity based unsupervised registration using metrics such as mean squared error and normalized
cross-correlation fails to capture anatomical correspondence across modalities, while weakly
supervised models driven by label similarity produce anatomically consistent results.
Affine preprocessing was shown to be essential in achieving stable deformation fields, and
non-rigid augmentation improved robustness without degrading generalization. These
results establish a practical foundation for anatomically faithful multimodal registration
and highlight key methodological considerations for similar applications in medical image
analysis."*
